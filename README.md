## Introduction

This is a small exercise tracker that logs your activity and keeps you on track with the logs of the people around you!

### Running the app

Since the app is still in development mode, run 
`npm i` and `npm start` 
inside of the server folder to start the folder and, again 
`npm i` and `npm start` 
in the root folder to start the client-side! After that, the app is available at localhost:3000
